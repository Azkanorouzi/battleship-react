🔴 Things i learned:

1- Having some great hands on experience with context api and improving my understanding of complex ui state
2- Using Type script
3- First experience with RTL (react testing library)

🤔 further improvements:

- Increasing test coverage
- Writing more comments
- Cleaning up complex components such as grid
- Using redux instead of context api would be more appropriate due to the complex ui logic of this application
